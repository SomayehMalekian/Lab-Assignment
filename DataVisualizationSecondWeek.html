 				Ecuador’s National Assembly passes a Human Mobility Law that regulates conditions of mobilized people, including Colombian refugees.
				Based on the newly passed law, refugees will be granted a national identification card.  It also provides support to refugee children and stateless people.
	            Colombians compensate over 95 percent of the total 60,000 refugees that this country hosts.
				UNHCR welcomes the move and would like to strengthen its cooperation with Ecuador to assure improvement of refugees’ living condition and access to their human rights.

 					Due to 50 years of war between guerrillas, paramilitaries and the army of Colombia, over half a million people of the country have fled to the neighboring countries. This is besides millions of displaced people within the borders.
					Out of this half million, only 70,000 refugees are registered with UNHCR.
					Many of these people have fled to Ecuador, Costa Rica, Panama, and Venezuela. European countries that have resettled Colombian refugees are Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

 				Colombian refugees face different threats. Here are the main challenges they have to deal with if they ever manage to successfully flee their country to Ecuador.
				a. Protection: Ecuadorian security cannot provide enough support to the Colombian people who have fled their countries. Sexual and gender-based violence is a constant risk. Some 80% of women population has reported experiencing gender-based violence.

				b. Local integration: finding dignified housing, access to healthcare, education and access to infrastructures like healthy food and clean water remains to be unsolved.
